always use pnpm
always prefer daisy ui components before making up new ones
ask for new library preferences to me before installing
we are using convex-auth
use proper loading indicators and sonner toasts
prefer if else instead of ternary conditions when dealing with more then single statement branchings.
divide into components for complex things. seperation of concerns is key
do not make unnecessary copy changes or style changes or logic changes unless asked for
